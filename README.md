# Data-analysis-with-Python
## Objectives
1) Review and download the Kaggle Automobile Dataset from: 

        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toramky/automobile-dataset

2) Supplement this dataset with additional records for cadillac, ford, chrysler, gmc, kia(at leat 3 records for each, total of 15 or more additonal records)

3) Perform full data quality analysis on this dataset and perform the following:

        a) Handle missing field values such as drop, replace by mean, replace by frequency
        b)correct data format
        c)standardize data
        d)Normalize data
        e)perform binning
        f)add new variable(s) (ex:indicator variable, of which you would use as a special feature).


## Data Wrangling procedure

### 1. Handle missing values
* Convert "?" to NaN -- In the car dataset, missing data comes with the question mark "?".
* Evaluating for Missing Data -- Here, check wether there were any anymore missing data
* Count missing values in each column -- Using a for loop in Python, count the number of null values in each column.

#### 1.1 Deal with missing data
In this section, i explain how i handles the missing data and justify the reasons for handling data in the way it was done.

##### 1.1.1 Drop data:
* Drop the whole row -- since "price" had 4 missing values, I simply deleted the whole row because price is what we want to predict. Any data entry without price data cannot be used for prediction; therefore any row now without price data is not useful to us

##### 1.1.2 Replace data
###### Replace it by mean:
Replace the missing data with the average of the column. Below columns were replaced with average values;
* "normalized-losses": 41 missing data, "stroke": 4 missing data, "bore": 4 missing data, "horsepower": 2 missing data, "peak-rpm": 2 missing data

##### Replace it by frequency
* Replace "num-of-doors" which has 2 missing data, with "four". -- Reason being : 84% sedans is four doors. Since four doors is most frequent, it is most likely to occur

### 2. Correct data format: 
Ensure that the data columns are in there correct data types before performing further analysis. The procedure I followed was:

* list the data types for each column
* Convert data types to proper format
        * bore,stroke, price and peak-prm to float
        * normalised losses to integer
* list the columns after the conversion
        
### 3. Standardize data
 * `Standardization` is the process of transforming data into a common format, allowing for meaningful comparison. In my dataset, the fuel consumption columns "city-mpg" and "highway-mpg" are represented by mpg (miles per gallon) unit. Assume we are developing an application in a country that accepts the fuel consumption with L/100km standard. We will need to apply data transformation to transform mpg into L/100km. The formula for unit conversion is: L/100km = 235 / mpg
        
### 4. Normalize data
* `Normalization` is the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range
*  I, for example, scaled the columns "length", "width" and "height". I normalized these variables so their value ranges from 0 to 1. Approach: replace original value by (original value)/(maximum value)        
        
### 5. Binning
* `Binning` is a process of transforming continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical 'bins' for grouped analysis.
* Example: --> In my dataset, "horsepower" is a real valued variable ranging from 48 to 288 and it has **57** unique values. What if we only care about the price difference between cars with high horsepower, medium horsepower, and little horsepower (3 types)? Can we rearrange them into three â€˜bins' to simplify analysis?
        I used the pandas method 'cut' to segment the 'horsepower' column into 3 bins.
* Bins Visualization - Here, i visualized the bins created above to see there distributions
        
### 6. Indicator Variable (or Dummy Variable)
We use indicator variables so we can use categorical variables for regression analysis in the later modules. The column "fuel-type" has two unique values: "gas" or "diesel". Regression doesn't understand words, only numbers. To use this attribute in regression analysis, we convert "fuel-type" to indicator variables.
